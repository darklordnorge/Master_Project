    abstract = {{This article describes a new algorithm for acquiring occupancy grid maps with mobile robots. Existing occupancy grid mapping algorithms decompose the high-dimensional mapping problem into a collection of one-dimensional problems, where the occupancy of each grid cell is estimated independently. This induces conflicts that may lead to inconsistent maps, even for noise-free sensors. This article shows how to solve the mapping problem in the original, high-dimensional space, thereby maintaining all dependencies between neighboring cells. As a result, maps generated by our approach are often more accurate than those generated using traditional techniques. Our approach relies on a statistical formulation of the mapping problem using forward models. It employs the expectation maximization algorithm for searching maps that maximize the likelihood of the sensor measurements.}},

@incollection{Cianci2007Communication,
    abstract = {{Swarm intelligence, and swarm robotics in particular, are reaching a point where leveraging the potential of communication within an artificial system promises to uncover new and varied directions for interesting research without compromising the key properties of swarm- intelligent systems such as self-organization, scalability, and robustness. However, the physical constraints of using radios in a robotic swarm are hardly obvious, and the intuitive models often used for describing such systems do not always capture them with adequate accuracy. In order to demonstrate this effectively in the classroom, certain tools can be used, including simulation and real robots. Most instructors currently focus on simulation, as it requires significantly less investment of time, money, and maintenanceâ€”but to really understand the differences between simulation and reality, it is also necessary to work with the real platforms from time to time. To our knowledge, our course may be the only one in the world where individual students are consistently afforded the opportunity to work with a networked multi-robot system on a tabletop. The e-Puck, a low-cost small-scale mobile robotic platform designed for educational use, allows us bringing real robotic hardware into the classroom in numbers sufficient to demonstrate and teach swarm-robotic concepts. We present here a custom module for local radio communication as a stackable extension board for the e-Puck, enabling information exchange between robots and also with any other IEEE 802.15.4-compatible devices. Transmission power can be modified in software to yield effective communication ranges as small as fifteen centimeters. This intentionally small range allows us to demonstrate interesting collective behavior based on local information and control in a limited amount of physical space, where ordinary radios would typically result in a completely connected network. Here we show the use of this module facilitating a collective decision among a group of 10 robots.}},

The system relies on infrared communications with frequency modulation and is composed of two interconnected modules for data and power measurement. Thanks to the open hardware license under which it is released, the research community can easily replicate the system at a low cost and/or adapt it for applications in sensor networks and in robotics.}},

@article{Kala2011Robotic,
    abstract = {{In this article, we propose a new algorithm to solve the problem of robotic path planning in static environment where the source and destination are given. A grid-based map has been used to represent the robotic world. The basic algorithm is built on an evolutionary approach, where the path evolves along with generations with each generation adding to the maximum possible complexity of the path. Along with complexity we optimise the total path length as well as the minimum distance from the obstacle in the robotic path. It may be seen that the value of evolutionary parameter number of individuals as well as the maximum complexity is less at start and more at the later stages of the algorithm. We use a Gaussian increase in these values whose parameter may be adjusted to control the time and output. Seven genetic operators have been implemented that include selection, crossover, soft mutation, hard mutation, insert, delete and elite. The phenotype representation consists of the coordinate where the robot is supposed to make a turn. This happens by the traversal of the path using these points by the evolutionary algorithm. Momentum determines the speed of the algorithm in this traversal.}},
