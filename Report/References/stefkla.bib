This papers presents a version of Markov localization  which provides accurate position estimates and which is tailored towards dynamic environments.  The key idea of Markov localization is to maintain a probability density over the  space of all locations of a robot in its environment. Our approach represents this space  metrically, using a ne-grained grid to approximate densities. It is able to globally localize  the robot from scratch and to recover from localization failures. It is robust to approximate  models of the environment (such as occupancy grid maps) and noisy sensors (such  as ultrasound sensors). Our approach also includes a ltering technique which allows a  mobile robot to reliably estimate its position even in densely populated environments in  which crowds of people block the robot's sensors for extended periods of time.

Virtually all existing occupancy grid mapping algorithms decompose the highdimensional mapping problem into a collection of onedimensional problems, where the occupancy of each grid cell is estimated independently of others. This induces conflicts that can lead to inconsistent maps. This paper shows how to solve the mapping problem in the original, highdimensional space, thereby maintaining all dependencies between neighboring cells. As a result, maps generated by our approach are often more accurate than those generated using traditional techniques. Our approach relies on a rigorous statistical formulation of the mapping problem using forward models.

environment by a team of robots. As in single-robot exploration the goal
is to minimize the overall exploration time. The key problem to be
solved therefore is to choose appropriate target points for the
individual robots so that they simultaneously explore different regions
of their environment. We present a probabilistic approach for the
coordination of multiple robots which, in contrast to previous
approaches, simultaneously takes into account the costs of reaching a
target point and the utility of target points. The utility of target
points is given by the size of the unexplored area that a robot can
cover with its sensors upon reaching a target position. Whenever a
target point is assigned to a specific robot, the utility of the
unexplored area visible from this target position is reduced for the
other robots. This way, a team of multiple robots assigns different
target points to the individual robots. The technique has been
implemented and tested extensively in real-world experiments and
simulation runs. The results given in this paper demonstrate that our
coordination technique significantly reduces the exploration time

@article{Abolhasan2004Review,
    abstract = {{The 1990s have seen a rapid growth of research interests in mobile ad hoc networking. The infrastructureless and the dynamic nature of these networks demands new set of networking strategies to be implemented in order to provide efficient end-to-end communication. This, along with the diverse application of these networks in many different scenarios such as battlefield and disaster recovery, have seen MANETs being researched by many different organisations and institutes. MANETs employ the traditional TCP/IP structure to provide end-to-end communication between nodes. However, due to their mobility and the limited resource in wireless networks, each layer in the TCP/IP model require redefinition or modifications to function efficiently in MANETs. One interesting research area in MANET is routing. Routing in the MANETs is a challenging task and has received a tremendous amount of attention from researches. This has led to development of many different routing protocols for MANETs, and each author of each proposed protocol argues that the strategy proposed provides an improvement over a number of different strategies considered in the literature for a given network scenario. Therefore, it is quite difficult to determine which protocols may perform best under a number of different network scenarios, such as increasing node density and traffic. In this paper, we provide an overview of a wide range of routing protocols proposed in the literature. We also provide a performance comparison of all routing protocols and suggest which protocols may perform best in large networks.}},

(private-note)Methods in this paper are based on real robots and use odometry data. Their approach uses sample data from the sensors and the odometry calculation. This sample data is then used in a gradient descent algorithm with each sample as a starting point. This guarantees that the global maximum likelihood can be found, and by that the best map.
Their approach also works with the absence of odometry data, as long as the world has sufficient variation. Should the world be to feature less no accurate map will be generated.
The map generated using the odometry data will always be more accurate. 
Though the title implements the usage of multiple robots the only documented approach to this is to rescan the map after a original map has been build by the "lead" robot. 
The second robot then localises it self on the map and improves the map, using the position of the first robot as a referance point for the already generated map. This appears to be highly accurate, however not entirely useful for my approach. 
Uses Monte Carlo localisation which is similar to Markov localisation. },

if it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown
location in an unknown environment and then to incrementally build a map
of this environment while simultaneously using this map to compute
absolute vehicle location. Starting from estimation-theoretic
foundations of this problem, the paper proves that a solution to the
SLAM problem is indeed possible. The underlying structure of the SLAM
problem is first elucidated. A proof that the estimated map converges
monotonically to a relative map with zero uncertainty is then developed.
It is then shown that the absolute accuracy of the map and the vehicle
location reach a lower bound defined only by the initial vehicle
uncertainty. Together, these results show that it is possible for an
autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown
environment and, using relative observations only, incrementally build a
perfect map of the world and to compute simultaneously a bounded
estimate of vehicle location. The paper also describes a substantial
implementation of the SLAM algorithm on a vehicle operating in an
outdoor environment using millimeter-wave radar to provide relative map
observations. This implementation is used to demonstrate how some key
issues such as map management and data association can be handled in a
practical environment. The results obtained are cross-compared with
absolute locations of the map landmarks obtained by surveying. In
conclusion, the paper discusses a number of key issues raised by the
