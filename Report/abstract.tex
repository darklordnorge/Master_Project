Using a swarm of mobile robots to explore and environment while maintaining communications between all robots is an interesting challenge.
In this paper a solution for this challenge utilising a Artificial Neural Network and a swarm of E-Puck robots is proposed.
The task of the swarm is to map a simple environment while maintaining communication range to each other. The created solution and its results are shown, critically analysed, and suggestions for future improvements are made.
